# Addiction to Approval

The need for constant approval from others can be a source of depression and anxiety.

## Signs of Approval Addiction

- Constantly seeking validation
- Fear of criticism or rejection
- Difficulty making decisions without others' input

## Breaking Free

- Recognize that approval is nice but not necessary
- Practice self-validation
- Set boundaries with people-pleasing behaviors

## Personal Reflection

Working on this has been challenging but liberating.
