## Content
I want to reflect on how I spent my last day in SF. I spent ~5 hours of my last day in SF in James Fang's apartment programming. I think I should have done things outside more. I want to remember this in the future. I feel bad because I didn't do things outside, which I know is good for me because I can serendipitously meet people.
