# The Super Powers You Get Without a Phone

### Ideas

Without a phone, you have super-human focus.
You have a better understanding of your own feelings. You are able to sense when you feel tired better, estimate your state better. Your phone adds some noise to your internal measurements.

More social interactions, without a phone you are more inclined to talk to other people, even if this is 10% more often, the benefit will compound.

I've ditched a smartphone and use a flip phone as my daily driver. Over the past few months of decreasing my dopamine baseline (listening to music, scrolling, being stimulated, porn, etc.) I've felt a fundamental change in my focus and how I spend my time. Very worthwhile.
