## Daily Reflection

**Write about my day, what happened?**

Worked on implementing the Catppuccin Mocha theme for the website. Made significant progress on the visual design system.

**What went well today? Growth, health, identity, wealth, relationships, environment, and happiness**

Successfully implemented a beautiful dark theme that enhances the user experience of my personal website.

**What went wrong? Why? How can I improve? Growth, health, identity, wealth, relationships, environment, and happiness**

Could have started earlier in the day to have more time for testing.

**What is something from my day today I don't want to forget?**

The satisfaction of seeing the Catppuccin Mocha colors come together in a cohesive design system.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

### Objectives

1. Test the website thoroughly across different devices and browsers

3. Plan the next phase of website features and improvements
