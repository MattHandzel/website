## Daily Reflection

**Write about my day, what happened?**

Focused on planning the website architecture and design system approach.

**What went well today? Growth, health, identity, wealth, relationships, environment, and happiness**

Made good progress on understanding the requirements for the personal website project.

**What went wrong? Why? How can I improve? Growth, health, identity, wealth, relationships, environment, and happiness**

Spent too much time in planning mode without taking action. Need to balance planning with execution.

**What is something from my day today I don't want to forget?**

The importance of having a clear vision before starting implementation.
