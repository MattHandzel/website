# Growth is Most Important

You cannot accomplish anything without growth. You are born as a baby with absolutely nothing. If you did not grow you would be crawling around on the floor your entire life, being unable to understand or be understood.

## Reflect Always

When doing any activity, reflect on it, there is valuable information in your experiences. Don't throw the experience in the trash, mine it for gold.

### Write Down Your Reflections

Write down your reflections, reflect on the reflections, humans need repetition to form habits and make change.

## Never Settle

Never settle for your current state. Always be looking to improve yourself, your situation, and your environment. If you are not improving, you are falling behind.

## You Should Cringe Thinking About Yourself 3 Months Ago

If you can cringe at your past self, this means you are growing. 3 months is a long enough time frame for a lot to happen in your life, and I think it is a good sized sprint. In 3 months you can train for a marathon, be conversationally fluent in a language, start a business and get your first customer.
