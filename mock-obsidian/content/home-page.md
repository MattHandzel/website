# Welcome to My Digital Life

I'm Matt, a software engineer passionate about quantified self, transhumanism, and rationalism. This website is my experiment in "living in public" - sharing the data, metrics, and insights that shape my daily existence.

## Current Focus

- Building systems for personal optimization
- Tracking and visualizing life metrics
- Exploring the intersection of technology and human potential
- Contributing to open source projects

## Recent Achievements

- Completed marathon training program
- Maintained 90%+ habit consistency for 6 months
- Launched 3 side projects
- Read 24 books this year

## Philosophy

I believe in radical transparency, continuous improvement, and using data to understand ourselves better. This website is both a showcase of my work and a living experiment in personal documentation.

Explore the various sections to see how I track habits, manage finances, monitor health metrics, and document my journey through life.
