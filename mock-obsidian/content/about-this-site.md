# About This Site

Welcome to my personal website - a comprehensive view into my quantified self journey and digital life.

This site represents my commitment to "living in public" by sharing the data, metrics, and insights that shape my daily existence. Every component you see here is powered by real data from my personal tracking systems, Obsidian vault, and various life metrics.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Quantified Self Dashboard**: Real-time metrics from my habits, health, finances, and productivity
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts and graphs you can explore and comment on
- **Personal Projects**: Documentation of my ongoing experiments and accomplishments
- **Digital Garden**: My thoughts, notes, and ideas in an interconnected web

## The Technology

This website follows a unique architecture where all content originates from markdown files in my Obsidian vault, gets processed by Python scripts, stored in a database, and then rendered through atomic React components. This ensures that everything you see reflects my actual lived experience and current thinking.

Feel free to explore, interact with the data, and leave comments on any section that interests you!
