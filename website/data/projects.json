    "content": "# Get Jacked\n\n## What\n\nFor this project, my goal is get jacked. Specifically, I want to be at around 12% body fat, which means I would need to weigh around 170 lbs.\n\n## Why\n\n**Personal Challenge**: I was an obese kid growing up (at 13 years old, I was ~5'6 and 220 lbs). Since then, I've been conscious of my health and the impact that aesthetics have on my confidence and how others perceive me. Back then, I would have thought getting a 6-pack is _theoretically possible_, but I cannot imagine it on me.\n\n**Health**: I believe it is optimal to be at the 10-15% body fat range for longevity, energy, and general health. I also have asthma, and I've noticed that as my body fat decreases, the amount of asthma attacks I get also decreases.\n\n## How\n\n- I'm going on a [[whole-food-plant-based-diet-for-30-days | whole food plant based diet]] which I suppose will allow me to lose weight.\n- I'm _not_ going to do anything unsustainable (multi-day fasting, excessive cardio, etc). I want to be able to maintain this lifestyle long term.\n- I will lose ~1-2 lbs per week, and I will do strength training 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) to maintain muscle and do light cardio (walking, biking) on the other days.\n- If I do not lose weight after 1 week, I will track my calories for 3 days to get a better estimate of how much I am eating.\n- I will do intermittent fasting (16:8)\n\n## When\n\nIf I lose 1 lb per week, I will reach my goal in 13 weeks, which is January 13th, 2026.\n\n## Progress\n\n- 183 lbs as of 2025-10-14\n\n## Media\n\n## Reflection\n\n## Who Else",

I estimate if I applied everything I have ever read into my life, it would be on the order of 100x times better[^1].\n\n## How\n\nThis will have a system to extract information from my Obsidian vault that I have deemed useful. Then it will convert that information into Anki cards. Every day, I will review several of these cards until they are fully implemented into my beliefs and behaviors. I will also need to do de-duplication of cards/concepts. Another great value add would be if I could pull up these concepts right before doing some behavior so that I can learn faster.\nI will study behavior change and learning literature to find the best way to reinforce these beliefs and behaviors into my life.\n\n## When\n\nI will have an MVP by mid-October.\n\n## Progress\n\n[First version](https://x.com/handzelmatt/status/1979591177117589636) of the system is done! 2025-10-18\n\n## Media\n\n## Reflection\n\n## Who Else\n\n[^1]: I estimate I probably spent ~1000 hours reading \"useful\" material in my lifetime.

The fellowship is a ten-week program aimed at making tangible _personal_ progress in the field of longevity biotechnology with a personal demo day on December 14th, 2025.\n\nFor this fellowship, my goal is to:\n\n- Solve a real problem for at least 1 person in the LBF. Supporting scientists, CEOs, improving their {creativity, productivity, searching, exploring, networking}.\n\n## Why\n\nI joined the LBF because I want to spend my life working on something that has high impact for a lot of people. Aging impacts everyone on a personal level, and it impacts society as a whole, so I want to explore if solving problems in the realm of longevity is my Ikigai. My specific goal of solving a problem for at least one person is I want to improve my agency, and learn how to make something that others want. I also believe at my current skillset, I cannot solve the \"hard\" problems, but I can do a support those that are solving the hard problems.\n\n## How\n\nBy reaching out to people who I've met at LBF7 or in the Slack, ask them what problems they have that I am capable of solving and is aligned with my studies.\nDraft up a project proposal and share it with whomever I am working with to get feedback and iterate on it.\nSpend no more than 3 hours per week working on this project, as I have other commitments (university, job search, etc).\nHave Scrum-like sprints once I have the MVP\n\n## When\n\nMake a MVP to solve their problem by November 2nd, 2025\nHave 4 rounds of iteration and feedback by December 7th, 2025\nPost the finished project by December 14th, 2025\n\n## Progress\n\n- [x] Post this \u201cmission/goal\u201d on the LBF Slack to \u201cfind\u201d problems.\n- [x] Reach out to those that have a company or are doing interesting work in the LBF Slack\n- [x] Message 5 people to solicit for problems they have/project ideas\n- [ ] Compile all of the \"user interviews\" I've conducted into a document\n- [ ] Brainstorm solutions for these people's problems\n- [ ] Write a project proposal for a maximum of 1 hour\n- [ ] Send it to stakeholders\n\n## Media\n\n## Reflection\n\nI've noticed I have a fear of asking people to help them. This is quite irrational as I am trying to help them, but I think it stems from a fear of failure.\n\n## Who Else",

Then I will draft a newsletter template in Markdown so I can easily edit it. I will figure out how to send it out to people. I want to send it out to people using a custom domain (personal-newsletter@matthandzel.com).\n\nFor the next version, I will make it much more complex. I will generalize this newsletter template for people in many different groups. So some sections will dynamically change depending on things such as our relationship closeness, shared interests, etc. I would additionally want to have a feature that people can very easily respond to me (via video, audio, text), so I can keep in touch with them and hear what they're doing!\n\nI might even do some A/B testing to see how I can make my newsletter optimize some metrics, such as \"conversations started\".\n\n## When\n\nI will compile the list of the beta testers October 25th, then I will draft the first newsletter by November 1st, and send it out by November 5th.\n\n## Progress\n\n## Media\n\n## Reflection\n\n## Who Else",
