    "content": "# Get Jacked\n\n## What\n\nFor this project, my goal is get jacked. Specifically, I want to be at around 12% body fat, and have visible abs.\n\n## Why\n\n**Personal Challenge**: I was an obese kid growing up (at 13 years old, I was ~5'6 and 220 lbs). Since then, I've been conscious of my health and the impact that aesthetics have on my confidence and how others perceive me. Back then, I would have thought getting a 6-pack is _theoretically possible_, but I cannot imagine it on me.\n**Health**: I believe it is optimal to be at the 10-15% body fat range for longevity, energy, and general health. I also have asthma, and I've noticed that as my body fat decreases, the amount of asthma attacks I get also decreases.\n\n## How\n\nIn order to be at ~12% body fat, I would need to weigh around \\~170 lbs (assuming no muscle loss), so I would need to lose \\~13 lbs.\nI'm going on a [[whole-food-plant-based-diet-for-30-days | whole food plant based diet]] which I suppose will allow me to lose weight.\nI'm _not_ going to do anything unsustainable (multi-day fasting, excessive cardio, etc). I want to be able to maintain this lifestyle long term.\nI will lose ~1-2 lbs per week, and I will do strength training 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) to maintain muscle and do light cardio (walking, biking) on the other days.\nIf I do not lose weight after 1 week, I will track my calories for 3 days to get a better estimate of how much I am eating.\nI will do intermittent fasting (16:8)\n\n## When\n\nIf I lose 1 lb per week, I will reach my goal in 13 weeks, which is January 13th, 2026.\n\n## Progress\n\n- 183 lbs as of 2025-10-14\n\n## Media\n\n## Reflection\n\n## Who Else",

    "content": "## What\n\n\"The Longevity Biotech Fellowship (LBF) is a community of hardcore Longevity Accelerationists. Our members build, join, and invest in revolutionary biotechnology projects for radical life extension.\" The LBF had a kickoff in Cofrentes, Spain on September 22nd, 2025. The fellowship is a ten-week program aimed at making tangible _personal_ progress in the field of longevity biotechnology with a personal demo day on December 14th, 2025.\n\nFor this fellowship, my goal is to:\n\n- Solve a real problem for at least 1 person in the LBF. Supporting scientists, CEOs, improving their {creativity, productivity, searching, exploring, networking}.\n\n## Why\n\nI joined the LBF because I want to spend my life working on something that has high impact for a lot of people. Aging impacts everyone on a personal level, and it impacts society as a whole, so I want to explore if solving problems in the realm of longevity is my Ikigai. My specific goal of solving a problem for at least one person is I want to improve my agency, and learn how to make something that others want. I also believe at my current skillset, I cannot solve the \"hard\" problems, but I can do a support those that are solving the hard problems.\n\n## How\n\nBy reaching out to people who I've met at LBF7 or in the Slack, ask them what problems they have that I am capable of solving and is aligned with my studies.\nDraft up a project proposal and share it with whomever I am working with to get feedback and iterate on it.\nSpend no more than 3 hours per week working on this project, as I have other commitments (university, job search, etc).\nHave Scrum-like sprints once I have the MVP\n\n## When\n\nMake a MVP to solve their problem by November 2nd, 2025\nHave 4 rounds of iteration and feedback by December 7th, 2025\nPost the finished project by December 14th, 2025\n\n## Progress\n\n- [x] Post this \u201cmission/goal\u201d on the LBF Slack to \u201cfind\u201d problems.\n- [x] Reach out to those that have a company or are doing interesting work in the LBF Slack\n- [x] Message 5 people to solicit for problems they have/project ideas\n- [ ] Draft a project proposal\n\n## Media\n\n## Reflection\n\nI've noticed I have a fear of asking people to help them. This is quite irrational as I am trying to help them, but I think it stems from a fear of failure.\n\n## Who Else",
