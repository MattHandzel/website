They provide the essential functions of a phone (communication over distance), having some additional features (gps, notes, calculator), without the \"smarter features\" (such as \"high performant applications\" or \"entertainment\"). They are harder to use and help \"[[reject convenience]]\"\n\nI think getting it is going to improve my life. I have gotten a glimpse of life without constant stimulation a few weeks ago when me and my roommates have formed a pact to use our phones less. I remember the feeling I had during the days of clarity in thought and [[intention]] in my actions. I have lost that a little bit because I had a bit of a habit of using laptop before bed, watching videos, masturbating, listening to music. This caused me to not go to bed. As of now, I am going to Madison Wisconsin and I want to make a large change to set myself up for a very goal-oriented summer. I have a lot of good momentum and in a much better mental position.\n\nI believe using a dumb-phone will help me reclaim even more of this thought and enforce to myself and my self-concept I am serious.\n\n### How it makes me think about others\n\nI have a little bt of a nagging feeling that technology addiction has snuck up on us. Every year a new phone is annouced and people get it because it is better, faster, more storage, but people never think about why they want those features. Sure they might want it because it is easier to use, but that is akin to a smoker getting a a more ergonomic pack of cigareets to minimize the time between opening the box and the cigareet entering his mouth. It is my belief phone mindless technology usage is harmful and I am getting off of this by using a dumb phone.\n\nEven now, I am not using my phone (because I have had a great habit of using it less, and I am writing instead. I am creating, using my brain, doing sometthing valuable.)\n\nUsing a dumbphone makes you an \"independent thinker\". I remember me being in high school and the teacher asked if anyone had an android. I was the only one in my class, but now I won't even have a smart phone. This makes me feel proud of myself, but I need to be warry of doing something just for the sake of being different.",
