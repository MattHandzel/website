I can embed this into an email, a footer for an email, my personal newsletter, etc. With this, I can \"create\" luck, (my network can give me ideas about trips I plan on going. If they plan on being in the same area at the time they can say hi). I can imagine this becoming generalized so that everyone has a map like this so their network can see where they will be.\n\nMaybe for my network, other people can write when and where they will be in the future and then I can see this on my map. I imagine this being in an email, someone is going on a trip to Spain in September, and then they can click on the map, a date, and then it will send me an email where they will be in the future. This is just me getting more value from my network. This should be accessible to anyone on my website. They also should be able to write a description of what they're doing there, why they are going, etc. This means my website won't be just a static website.\n\nOn a map I can visualize a lot of things, specifically my travels, where I've been and where I intend on being in the future. I image a map with a timeline where the user can scrub forward and backwards to see how I have traveled, they can maybe select a range of time (example October 2024-January 2025) and then see where I've been during that time.\n\nThis system can perhaps interact with my personal network? It can show events in my life, such as when and where I met specific people during my travels.\n\nI can/want to do something like this: https://aaronparecki.com/2012/03/06/7/everywhere-ive-been-gps-data-portraits",

It should combine all of instagram, linkedin, etc.\n\nFor example, my internship at epic I should have on there, all of my adventures, accomplishments, periods in my life\n\nMy online website should use data about my life from my obsidian vault.\n\nFrom this website, someone can get a hollistic view of who I am as a person.\n\nBy building this so that it is available on my website, anything I put on there I implicitly build a tracking system.\n\nMy website is me \"living in public\"\n\nFor most of my areas of my life, my systems, interests, have them be visible on my website\n\nA principle for this website is the idea of others being able to quickly and easily interact with my ideas, leave me notes. This can be component specific. For example, in the physiological health metrics component, someone can select a part of the chart and give me a suggestion for that. For the map component, someone can highlight a section and tell me about how there is something very cool there. They can also highlight it and say they will be there in the future. Give a lot of interactivity to this. Allow the user to login and write their name on my personal website, by going on my personal website, they are personally interacting with me.\n\nI want to record how people interact with my website, using something like posthog.",

Also, perhaps, buy email domain on there as well.\n\n### Synchronizing Personal Website With My Data\n\nI have many data sources, each data source has it's own method of synchronization. For every method, do that synchronization. If that data source is public, then copy its data to a database on supabase, oracle, etc.\n\n#### Data Mining\n\nFor each 'different type' of data, (dailies, relationships, etc.) create a separate function that takes in the directory the data is stored, does processing on it, normalizes it, and stores it in a database.\n\nDepending on the folder, specify data mining techniques, prompts, etc.\n\n### Website\n\nThe website will be made up of many different components, the components are defined either as separate files, or in [[components]]. Each component should be atomic and it will source data from my obsidian vault.\n\nI want all of the copy to be a function of markdown documents. For example, the \"About This Site\" section should be populated by a preprocessing stage, where the pre-processor looks into my obsidian vault, finds a markdown file called about-this-site.md, parses the contents of that file, puts it into a database, and then the website reads from that database.\n\n### Architecture\n\nSo the architecture of this application is that there's going to be an obsidian vault on my like laptop, computer, whatever. And then, whenever I want to update the data on or for my website, I will run. Program. This is probably a python script, and it will. The python script will have many different functions that will look at my obsidian Vault and like, find files and do processing of.\n\nIt'll do processing of the data that I have. And then it will take all that information and then put that into a database. For development that databases will be local in the future of the database will be online. And then. When a user? Right. When a user opens my website, it will use the information from.\n\nThough, like the website, when it's being rendered. It'll use information from my database. That is online.\n\nSo that? My webs. My personal website can be updated in somewhat real time. Whenever I run this data processing script.\n\nMy obsidian Vault is.\n\nTilda slash obsidian/ main/. And this is obsidian Vault and. And then the python script. I'll make specific functions that point to specific files, and then does parsing on them.",

    "content": "[[article]]\n\n# Dumbphones\n\nSmartphones but dumb. They provide the essential functions of a phone (communication over distance), having some additional features (gps, notes, calculator), without the \"smarter features\" (such as \"high performant applications\" or \"entertainment\"). They are harder to use and help \"[[reject convenience]]\"\n\nI think getting it is going to improve my life. I have gotten a glimpse of life without constant stimulation a few weeks ago when me and my roommates have formed a pact to use our phones less. I remember the feeling I had during the days of clarity in thought and [[intention]] in my actions. I have lost that a little bit because I had a bit of a habit of using laptop before bed, watching videos, masturbating, listening to music. This caused me to not go to bed. As of now, I am going to Madison Wisconsin and I want to make a large change to set myself up for a very goal-oriented summer. I have a lot of good momentum and in a much better mental position.\n\nI believe using a dumb-phone will help me reclaim even more of this thought and enforce to myself and my self-concept I am serious.\n\n### How it makes me think about others\n\nI have a little bt of a nagging feeling that technology addiction has snuck up on us. Every year a new phone is annouced and people get it because it is better, faster, more storage, but people never think about why they want those features. Sure they might want it because it is easier to use, but that is akin to a smoker getting a a more ergonomic pack of cigareets to minimize the time between opening the box and the cigareet entering his mouth. It is my belief phone mindless technology usage is harmful and I am getting off of this by using a dumb phone.\n\nEven now, I am not using my phone (because I have had a great habit of using it less, and I am writing instead. I am creating, using my brain, doing sometthing valuable.)\n\nUsing a dumbphone makes you an \"independent thinker\". I remember me being in high school and the teacher asked if anyone had an android. I was the only one in my class, but now I won't even have a smart phone. This makes me feel proud of myself, but I need to be warry of doing something just for the sake of being different.",
