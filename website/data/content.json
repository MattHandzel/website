From the perspective of evolutionary biology, children are wired to play because it helps foster social relationships and dynamics. It also allows them to master motor movements.\nAt every stage of development there are different types of play. Babies are played with in a simple way, by making faces to the baby. Once the baby is able to walk, it can interact with others of a similar age group, holding hands, following. They can also play \"predator and cooperation games\" which are sports, hide-and-seek, tag. Then, when they go into middle school they learn social games, such as teasing and joking.\n\nHunans enjoy playing sports because we are evolved to enjoy to play them, it mimics hunting.\n\nThe purpose of childhood is to mimic adulthood but with lower stakes. If this is skipped, you end up with adults that are not ready for the reality of adulthood with all the stakes of real life.\n\n[[play-should-be-free]]",
