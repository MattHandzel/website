I want this website to entirely represent who I am, what I care about, how I think, what are my \"inputs\", and \"outputs\".\n\n## Why Am I Doing This?\n\nI'm very much into quantified self and I have a fear of posting myself online.\n\nFor those that know me, this is a place where you can check in and see how I'm doing\nFor those that don't know me, this is a place for you to get an authentic understanding of who I am.\n\n## What You Can Find Here\n\nMy [habits](https://www.matthandzel.com/dailies), [bucket list](https://www.matthandzel.com/bucket-list), [communities](https://www.matthandzel.com/communities), [books](https://www.matthandzel.com/content-consumed) I've read, and my captured [thoughts](https://www.matthandzel.com/thoughts), ideas, notes.\n\n## How It Works\n\nAll content originates from markdown files in my Obsidian vault, which gets processed by Python scripts, stored in a database, and then rendered through atomic React components.\n\nFeel free to explore, interact, and let me know your thoughts at handzelmatthew [at] gmail.com",

I can embed this into an email, a footer for an email, my personal newsletter, etc. With this, I can \"create\" luck, (my network can give me ideas about trips I plan on going. If they plan on being in the same area at the time they can say hi). I can imagine this becoming generalized so that everyone has a map like this so their network can see where they will be.\n\nMaybe for my network, other people can write when and where they will be in the future and then I can see this on my map. I imagine this being in an email, someone is going on a trip to Spain in September, and then they can click on the map, a date, and then it will send me an email where they will be in the future. This is just me getting more value from my network. This should be accessible to anyone on my website. They also should be able to write a description of what they're doing there, why they are going, etc. This means my website won't be just a static website.\n\nOn a map I can visualize a lot of things, specifically my travels, where I've been and where I intend on being in the future. I image a map with a timeline where the user can scrub forward and backwards to see how I have traveled, they can maybe select a range of time (example October 2024-January 2025) and then see where I've been during that time.\n\nThis system can perhaps interact with my personal network? It can show events in my life, such as when and where I met specific people during my travels.\n\nI can/want to do something like this: https://aaronparecki.com/2012/03/06/7/everywhere-ive-been-gps-data-portraits",

This can be component specific. For example, in the physiological health metrics component, someone can select a part of the chart and give me a suggestion for that. For the map component, someone can highlight a section and tell me about how there is something very cool there. They can also highlight it and say they will be there in the future. Give a lot of interactivity to this.

Also, perhaps, buy email domain on there as well.\n\n### Synchronizing Personal Website With My Data\n\nI have many data sources, each data source has it's own method of synchronization. For every method, do that synchronization. If that data source is public, then copy its data to a database on supabase, oracle, etc.\n\n#### Data Mining\n\nFor each 'different type' of data, (dailies, relationships, etc.) create a separate function that takes in the directory the data is stored, does processing on it, normalizes it, and stores it in a database.\n\nDepending on the folder, specify data mining techniques, prompts, etc.\n\n### Website\n\nThe website will be made up of many different components, the components are defined either as separate files, or in [[components]]. Each component should be atomic and it will source data from my obsidian vault.\n\nI want all of the copy to be a function of markdown documents. For example, the \"About This Site\" section should be populated by a preprocessing stage, where the pre-processor looks into my obsidian vault, finds a markdown file called about-this-site.md, parses the contents of that file, puts it into a database, and then the website reads from that database.\n\n### Architecture\n\nSo the architecture of this application is that there's going to be an obsidian vault on my like laptop, computer, whatever. And then, whenever I want to update the data on or for my website, I will run. Program. This is probably a python script, and it will. The python script will have many different functions that will look at my obsidian Vault and like, find files and do processing of.\n\nIt'll do processing of the data that I have. And then it will take all that information and then put that into a database. For development that databases will be local in the future of the database will be online. And then. When a user? Right. When a user opens my website, it will use the information from.\n\nThough, like the website, when it's being rendered. It'll use information from my database. That is online.\n\nSo that? My webs. My personal website can be updated in somewhat real time. Whenever I run this data processing script.\n\nMy obsidian Vault is.\n\nTilda slash obsidian/ main/. And this is obsidian Vault and. And then the python script. I'll make specific functions that point to specific files, and then does parsing on them.",

They all work together and eventually they marched at some guy's funeral.\n\nTeams are also autonomous meaning that their self organizing and self managing they have the power to make their own decisions about how they do their jobs and are empowered to make those decisions stick.\n\n- The reason why being empowered and acting autonomously is that only a single team is able to exactly understand what's the best thing to do for them in the next moment this is a little bit of a slippery slope because it assumes that everyone there is confident and working towards the same goal therefore if you have confident people and if you are all aligning your goal then being autonomous is the best way to do things\n\nFinally cross function meaning that they have all the skills needed to complete the project planning design production sales distribution and those skills feed and reinforce each other. If you have all these people in one team then when you're making decisions you could think about it from everyone's perspective meaning the whole team's perspective instead of just your own.\n\n- The main reason why having a cross functional team is so powerful is that you have everybody in some team meaning that there's less information lost if everyone attends every stand up meeting then people know exactly where the project is and you don't need to communicate as much Moreover when having a more diverse set of skills there's more creativity that you have.",

    "content": "There's this part of the book where they say that about 85% of the effort in a company is wasted. And I think this is very interesting, I'm wondering how it applies at Epic. So one reason, for example, why things tend to be wasted is that because the market is not there or the direction has changed, and this is really frustrating for employees. Some other questions that I have related to this is, in other places in life, how much effort is wasted? Is this a human thing? I would think so. I really want to reflect on this and spend a lot of time reflecting on it. Another question is, how much does my phone usage impact my work? Or the lack of phone usage, actually. This is another idea in the book that waste is a crime. So there's three different types of wastes. Waste through unreasonableness, waste through inconsistency, and waste through outcomes. Some examples are waste in inventory, to waste of not doing it right the first time, to waste of working too hard, to emotional waste of unreasonable expectations. So now this goes into the different types of wastes noted in the book. So the first one is to do one thing at a time. So multitasking causes failures. People who multitask, they end up not even being, like, multitasking is just a myth. You cannot multitask. You can only switch tasks. And when you are not focusing on one task, then you are just not focusing on it, so you're not paying attention. So for example, with car accidents, there's a statistic in the book that people who are on, who are just talking on the cell phone, not even just typing on it, they are more likely to risk, even people who have, even teenagers that have other people in the car, the more people that you have in the car, the more likely you are to get into an accident. People just don't see that they're about to get into a car accident. In fact, not only is it true that multitasking doesn't exist, we actually tend to perceive that our ability to multitask is much higher than it actually is. And people who are most likely to multitask and most apt to use a cell phone while driving are those who have inflated views of their multitasking ability, which makes sense. And then this. And then because the author claims that multitasking fails you, I'm curious as to when are there cases where multitasking actually just does not fail you. So are there things that don't need your attention? For example, just like walking. Walking requires almost no effort at all. So it's completely automatic. Does that mean that you can't do subway walking or more random breathing? Is the fact that I'm breathing, does it decrease my ability to think? I don't think so. Another just mind perspective shifting is that multitasking is a symptom of a problem, not a solution. Multitasking, we can't hold attention. This is how I feel about my phone usage, for example. And if you are in a workplace where you need to multitask in order to be effective, then you are just not working effectively. And there's like a humongous cognitive effort to multitasking. And it's shown in an example in the book where the waste is shown where you have to write down the numbers 1 through 10 in different representations. So in the Arabic rules, then in Roman numerals, and then in the alphabet. So A, B, C, D, E, F, G, etc. And when you do it with the multitasking approach, which is by switching the context, then it takes you about twice as long to do it than if you're not doing it with the context switching. So it means that you're wasting about half of your effort for absolutely no reason. This is something that I want to internalize. So millions of, this is all around the world, probably millions of dollars is lost because of people switching context so frequently. And there's this other chart given in the book where there's the number, where they did a study of the number of simultaneous projects, as well as the number of, and as well as the loss to context switching. So with one project, then 100% of the time is available for this project, and zero is lost to context switching. While when there's two, 40% is available per project, and 20% is lost to context switching. And then with five, 5% is available for a project, and 75% is lost due to context switching. So that means that you are losing more when you have more projects. This does not necessarily mean that it's bad. For example, if you're blocked in one project, then if you go to another project, you'll probably be unblocked. You might, like, you might have to wait for it to be unblocked. So this is not directly compute deficiency, but it's definitely good to notice. And then look, the scientific basis for this is that they tried to do a study with people where they did do tasks, and they saw that the amount of time it takes to do tasks when you have to just focus on one more thing doubles. So he would ask one group of people to do a press a button if a light was on, and then he'd ask another, and then he'd give another group the same task plus a simpler one, like pressing a different button depending on the color of the flashing light. And then when the amount of, when the next task was added, the amount of time it took to complete the task doubled. So we can only think about literally one thing at a time. That's like a fundamental limitation to the brain. So the author suggests that when teams have multiple projects, they should just focus on one project instead of doing the context for the project. So the author thinks that you can definitely save half of your effort by doing this. So this leads to a goal that you should minimize distraction, context switching, and this is related to the Deep Workbook. It's impossible to not multitasking in this world, but it's important to be conscious of the multitasking. And then, so this idea of context switching, like your brain has a mental change when there's context switching. You have to like load your cache. So you should try to structure your day so that you have as little of these cold reads as possible. So at the end of the day, it'd be good to determine the next steps for the next day so you don't have to load the context. And I want to have a reflection on explicitly thinking about the process of loading context into my brain. What is the fastest way to do it? How can I use this knowledge in order to get work done faster? This is another idea that I've been trying to read ahead for books. So I read about the entirety of the book, skim through, read the context, read the chapters. and then when i am done with skmming I continue to read it. I feel like I remember more by doing this, I should do this whenever I read anything. Think about skimming ahead or prelearning material. Think about learning as a process, not just memorization.\n\nOn the topic of waste, there's this other idea in the book that half done is not done at all, and it just makes so much sense to me. If you have spent half of your effort making 10 things half done, then you have nothing done. You have no value provided to the customer. That is the goal with organizations, is to provide value. Therefore, you should aim to finish things as fast as possible. Minimize the amount of in-progress things that you have to do. The next idea is to do things right the first time. There's this problem of rework in manufacturing. If you have to do something, and someone else has to do it again, then that is just a waste of time. Why don't you just make it right the first time? Essentially, doing it right the first time means that when you are ready to ship it, there are not that many problems. For example, designing a good system architecture is doing it right the first time. Then how do you actually make it right the first time? This is maybe related to the discussion that I had earlier of how do you know about the trade-off between designing and shipping, because they seem to be at odds, but maybe they're not. Maybe we could do something similar to how car manufacturing is done where, if there's a problem, then it stops the entire production and tries to solve that problem. If someone sees there's an architectural problem, then note that problem down and try to solve it immediately so that there are no future errors. There's not production being done on things that are fundamentally broken. Oh, and this is a humongous statistic that I did not know about. In software development, when there is a bug, then if you do not solve it the day that it is found and instead wait three weeks, then it takes 24 times longer to actually fix the bug. Part of that reason is because you have to remember where the system was at that time, and other parts of the system could have been built on top of that, of the current system. So, not only do you have to fix this bug, but you have to so fixing the bug is not just like changing the bug, but you have to re-identify what the problem is, put yourself in the same headspace, and then you'll also have to fix the other parts of the system that are caused by the bug. So, I want to implement this into my own development, where if I see a bug happening, then I try to fix it right away, and then I also write a test case that proves that it is fixed. So, write and test code on the same day. This strategy works because if you write code and then test it, then you'll catch any bugs the same day that it's written, and it'll be really easy to fix, and you won't be building on top of them. This is why you should try testing as soon as possible. Fix it as soon as you notice that there's a problem. The next idea of this section is that working hard makes more work. So, basically, there's a story about how there's a company where they'd work six days, or they work seven days a week, but one person, for religious reasons, he only worked six days a week, and he found that he was getting more work done than people that were working every day. So, how is this possible if he's working less? Well, fundamentally, there's a difference between effort and output. So, it makes sense that if you there's some point where if you put too much effort into something, then the output decreases. So, like, if you imagine forcing someone to work 24 hours a day for seven days a week, then their output would be zero because they do not have time to rest. And so, you have to so you can imagine moving this hours per week back and back and back until you get to the optimal point, and the optimal point is not 40 hours a week. The author thinks that with the waterfall technique, then the optimal output is about 60 hours per week, but with Scrum, it's about 35 hours per week, but this is obviously based on the individual because it's based off of rest. So, if you can rest and recover faster, then you could work more hours per week, and you could output more per week. Another thing that I want to note is that when you it's not only that you're outputting less because you're tired, but the output that you make is bad. You make bad decisions that you have to fix in the future. So, by improving your decision making, okay, by improving your rest, you improve your decision making skills, which then improves your output and your output performance. So, if you can rest and recover faster, then you could output more hours per week, and you could output more per week. Another thing that I want to note is that even if you're doing less, if you're putting in less effort, and there's also a problem in organizations of burnout, and then, of course, this obviously solves the problem of burnout because if you don't have to work, like, burnout is a function of not resting enough. So, if you do rest enough, then you won't burn out, and I have an example of when I was a student. Like, I've seen many, many times that I work on assignment for probably five times the amount that I could have done because I was not thinking or planning or understanding the assignment perfectly, and I wasted so much time doing it, and I was just kind of, like, brute force through it instead of thinking about how to do the assignment, and it was a change. It was a shift in my mind when I realized that I should spend time planning the assignment out and planning when to do it and then try to do my implementation all in one day, doing my planning in one day, et cetera, instead of just trying to slog through it, and I definitely found that that was helpful for me. And this is not from the book, but it's an idea that I remember from a YouTube video that I watched, and that is that higher quality is correlated with higher speed, even though it seems contradictory, but it makes sense. If you make higher quality software, then you can ship faster because there's less bugs. Fundamentally, there's an idea that progress is not equal to effort. People can start making mistakes, which then have to be solved. I also have this note about peak output as a function of physical health and the state of the body. So, then, what's the best tradeoff between the two? Like, try to imagine forcing yourself only working 10 hours in a day. Can you go faster? Yeah. So, can you imagine that your body is, like, in a peak physical state, and then you can work for 10 hours a day and make a humongous output? And this is also somewhat tied to the book Essentialism, where, like, the graph of peak output, you gain a lot of output. So, you get 100%, like, completed workload at about 15 hours, and then at 30 hours, you get about 140. So, you gain most of the results by a little bit of the effort. That's just a fundamental principle about life. So, then, thinking about that more, it seems like the best thing to do is to work on, like, one thing, but not that much, and then also work on other things. But that's a little bit contradictory, because it goes against the idea or the principle of multitasking. Or it goes against the principle that multitasking is ineffective. So, how do you balance it out? Can you gain 200% effort in two different projects by working 10 hours a week on both of them? I'm not sure. I have to think about that more. Here are also some other things that impact the amount of output you can have. Physical fitness, diet, personal issues, other factors. Oh, this is just a note that I had. So, people found that the so, this is a very classic case of judges where they found that whether or not a prisoner's case was heard at around, like, after the judges were arrested, and the judges were in a more jovial mood, that determined whether or not they would go free or not. And that is just really fucked up, I think, because it shows that people don't understand why they make decisions, and, like, morally, it seems completely, it seems entirely messed up that your fate can be decided based off of a random event. That doesn't make me feel good. Makes me think that I should think more about what makes my decisions and what makes other people's decisions. What if I could make a software that would help identify the reasons, or what if I could make a decision-making software where it knows information about your life, what your goal is, and it helps you make a decision, and it does it very analytically. Like, it contains information about decision-making from all the books that I read about emotions, et cetera. It takes your life principles and helps compute things to do. And there's this idea or principle in the book that, like, measure output, do not measure effort. So you should not measure how many hours an employee works, just the output, hours are a cost. They cost human potiential, happiness, rest.\n\nThere's another idea that all this reading makes me think about, and that idea is that we have so much choice over how we can improve our lives. So an example is in the book where if you work more, then you don't gain as much. So the more hours that you work, does that mean more outputs? That means that those hours are just wasted, and waste hurts so much, because it could have been otherwise. There's a fundamental problem or regret that I feel is that waste is something that should be avoided at all costs. I just want to be clear on that.\n\nThe next topic about waste is being reasonable. This man from Toyota named Ono talks about three different types of wastes that lead people to working harder for more hours than necessary. One of these races wastes through unreasonableness, which is extremely powerful. The first unreasonable way that things are wasteful is absurdity. This is when you give goals to your team that are absurd and impossible. This is unreasonable because there's an emotion of turmoil with not making it. Because this goal is unreasonable, your team feels like they have to work longer hours in order to accomplish it. You don't want them striving for these absurd goals. The second is unreasonable expectations, which is the idea of there being a hero that saves the project. Someone that stays late, works eight hours one week, and saves the project. That's an unreasonable expectation from people to have. It encourages people to work harder and longer than necessary. The other type of waste is called overburdening, which is like work that is meaningless and has no value. Company policies are reporting the people to fill out or meaningless meetings that suck up time that don't deliver any value. That's a waste through overburdening. Another waste, the final type of this waste, is emotional waste, which is essentially when someone is just being an asshole. Essentially when someone is just being an asshole, and they suck up life from people. So don't allow assholes in your company. And then the antithesis of waste is the idea of flow, where there's no unnecessary processes, meetings, forms, reporting, etc. There's just creating exactly what the customer wants, even if the customer doesn't know that they want it yet. So that is the goal to have. This idea of flow is a discipline. It's human nature to be wasteful, because waste comes from lack of planning or understanding. The root of getting to flow is discipline, and that's related to the Essentialism book, where it's the disciplined pursuit of less. Moving from waste to more of the Scrum process is that whenever you make a task or you make a user story, then there needs to be a definition of done, which is obvious. And when this definition of done is met, then you are done with the task. This prevents a lot of rework, because you know exactly when it's done, and you also know exactly when to stop. And then the book talks more about uncertainty. Typically, at project outset, there's an econ of uncertainty, where projects simply take anywhere from 25% of the thought time to 400% of the thought time. So it does not make sense to make a plan, because as time increases, the uncertainty decreases. Therefore, it makes sense to iteratively plan along the way. And if you do want to plan something, then the first step is for you to make a backlog of everything that you need. So in an example of wedding, you create a list of bride and groom, flowers, invitations, church, reception hall, food, officiants, dress, wedding rings, music. And then the next thing that you do is you prioritize those based off of what is the most important thing. So bride and groom is probably more important, but then you also have a backlog of everything that you need. So what is the most important thing? So bride and groom is probably more important than getting flowers or the church. And the next thing you need is an efficient type of wedding. That's more important than food or music. So because you prioritize, then you get the most value the fastest. And there's another idea in this book, and that is that humans are terrible at estimating exact amounts, but we're very good at assuming relative sizes between things. So this leads to planning poker, which is a method of planning where you get cards that are assigned 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40. And from these cards, for every single task, you decide relatively how many points it is relative to other tasks. And this is easy because it's obvious to see the difference between a 1 and a 2 and a 5 and an 8, but it's harder to see the difference between an 8 and a 7. And because you know that your estimates are going to be incorrect by orders of magnitude, then you know that it's not that important to spend a lot of time with this planning. And then another idea is that if you estimate in a group, and if you have the people that are actually doing the work estimate, then you can get a better estimate because you kind of average out people's uncertainties. Another section of the book is about the Oracle of Delphi, which is a way of estimating that gets around this idea of the bandwagon effect. The bandwagon effect is that someone says something, and then that kind of anchors everyone else's ideas of what that thing should be. So an example is for auctions. If you start out an auction and someone says that they think it's worth $1,000, then nobody's going to think that it's worth $10. So they're going to be anchored around that point. So the Oracle of Delphi avoids this. Because typically how planning works is that it's kind of like a Markov chain where at time step zero, someone says some piece of information, and that kind of narrows down the scope of possibilities for everyone else. And then another person adds information, and that narrows down the scope of everyone else. But this doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense for information to go through this sequential thing. Because the goal with any process of estimating is that if you change the order in which information is given, then it should not change the estimate. Because the order in which it's given should not matter. So the Oracle of Delphi does this by having everybody respond anonymously. And because it's anonymous, and because you don't see other people's estimates, then you're not biased towards them. But the Oracle of Delphi method allows you to gain information from other experts. The idea of bandwagon is related to groupthink. You should try to avoid groupthink in an organization by doing something akin to the Delphi method. So people give information out anonymously. And they are allowed to query the Oracle for information. The scientific name for this is an information cascade, which occurs when it is optimal for an individual, having observed the actions of those ahead of him, to follow the behavior of the preceding individual without regard to his own information. So this happens all the time. If you are publishing something, and if you give it to a first journal and they reject it, the next journal editor is more likely to reject it because they'll use the previous information. So actually, idea or insight, how can we apply this to our own life? You should try to show off to other people the successes that you've had, because it's more likely that the next will be successful. We should try to avoid failures. You should avoid sharing failures. This is related to the idea of the halo effect. The halo effect is that if you have some positive characteristics, then they're more likely to be ranked by other positive characteristics. And you can use this halo effect whenever people tend to associate some characteristic with another positive characteristic. And I want to add this in my life because I want to gain the benefit of the halo effect. So for example, dressing well is an example of using the halo effect, or being fit is an example of using the halo effect to your advantage. Another example of the halo effect is that non-governmental organizations are often treated as forces for good, even if they aren't. A key principle of the Delphi method is that it allows you to use the halo effect to your advantage.\n\nAn example of the halo effect being used is where they did a study where they tried to use, or, no, this is not an example of the halo effect being used. This is an example of the Oracle Delphi technique being used. Researchers wanted to conduct an estimate of how many atomic bombs it would take to, like, have a 50% confidence of destroying the U.S. arms industry. And that range initially was 50 to 5,000. Then the researchers asked the experts why they made those decisions, and then they gave some reasons why. And the researchers then queried other experts and gave them back information that would help refine the reasons why. So at the first iteration of this, it was 50 at the low end to 5,000 at the high end. Then the next iteration, it was 89 and 800. And then the final iteration was 167 and 360. So a humongous decrease in the uncertainty from these experts was made by using this technique. The next section is about there being only tasks. There are no tasks, there are only stories. So this fundamentally comes down from the idea that people think in narratives. So if you give people a narrative, then it gives you a lot of power, because tasks only give people the what of what needs to be done. It doesn't say who this is being used for or why this is being used. By giving your customers a persona, then it allows you to prioritize and get some sort of estimate of their likes, dislikes, passions, enthusiasms, frustrations, and joys. And then there's a caveat that when you write your stories, you have to be sure that they're small enough that you can estimate them. So an example given the book is like this story by Amazon is humongous. So Amazon's customer stories as a customer, I want the world's biggest online booksellers that can buy any book anytime I want. So this is too big to do anything with to estimate. So you have to break it down into different stories. So for example, one story could be as a customer, I want to be able to browse book by genre and then find the types of book that I like. And this is a task that can be estimated. You know, you get a database of books, you get a website, and then you allow search for books by genres. The next story is as a customer, I want to put a book in a shopping cart so that I can buy it. And this is entirely separate from searching books by genre so that you can find the type of books that you like. This is like, you know, a book that you like, and then you can buy it. And then there's another one, which is as a project manager, I want to be able to track my customers purchases so I can market specific books to her based on purchases. This is an entirely, this is another entirely different user story. And something about these user stories is that they're front to back. So the user never says, I want to have a database, I can, like, I want to have a database, I can look at books, that doesn't make any sense. So they're front to back, they're fully featured in the give value.\n\nWhen you're writing stories, you have to make sure that the story is both ready before you act on it, and that you have to know when it's done. To know when it's ready and done, there is an acronym called INVEST. The INVEST criteria are that the story should be independent. This means that it must be actionable and complete on its own. It shouldn't be inherently dependent on another story. It should be negotiable, meaning that until it's actually being done, it needs to be able to be rewritten. Allowance for change is built in. It must be valuable, meaning that it actually delivers value to a customer or user or stakeholder. It must be estimatable. You have to be able to size it. It must be small. This means that the story needs to be small enough to be able to estimate and plan for it easily. If it is too big, it could write it or break it down into smaller stories. It must be testable. A story must have a test. If it was a pass, it should be complete. Write the test before you do the story. This test can be the acceptance test. An example story is, as a special forces medic, I must teach basic psychophysiology to my students so they can understand the human body. This is not just a criteria, because it's independent. You can accomplish this mission without having to consider other things, like the helicopter fuel it will take to get to the site. A story is negotiable, because teaching affiliate physiology is a story he thinks he needs to do, but if he gets there and students are already knowledgeable, he can change it. It's valuable because the students will learn practical and applicable knowledge of the human body. It's small. It's basic anatomy, not how to do surgery. This test shows the information he wants to impart. He can give his students a test to see if they've actually learned the information. As before, for each story there should be a definition of ready. So, does this mean that it meets the criteria? And finally, a definition of done. If stories are really ready, meaning that they meet all the investment criteria, then the team will double the speed of the implementation. And if stories aren't really done at the end of a sprint, the team can double the speed again, because you don't have to do reworking where you don't have any waste. This is a trick, and you can get twice as much done in half the time. So, sprint planning. In Scrum, there's a sprint planning that happens where you get everyone together, and then you look at a list of stories that have to be done within it. People say, what can we get accomplished at this sprint? Are these stories ready? Can they be done at the end of this iteration? Can we then demo them to a customer and show real value? So, before the sprint planning meeting, you have to get the backlog done. After you get the backlog, you do the sprint. You do the planning for this sprint, and this sprint is defined.\n\nSo, now that you know what you're doing in the sprint, your user story, you can now know your velocity. So, you know, like, you can estimate how long it'll take each item to do, and then you know what item to do during a week, because you know those two things, you can figure out how many points you do per week, and then you can estimate your velocity, because you can estimate your velocity. You know whether or not you're, like, you're getting faster or not, so you figure out what's happening. An example of this would be in the book about a story of planting a plumbing sprung, there was a, there's a company called Medco, and it deals with sending prescriptions through the mail. And they had a project that the author, Jeff Sutherland, they asked him to help them implement Scrubber to go faster. They were worried that it was going to take years longer than the deadline, and the deadline was six months from now. So, the first thing that they did was they started implementing Scrum by getting all the requirements and removing a lot of the boilerplate, and then writing them up into user stories, then doing estimation to figure out how long each task will take, and then prioritizing and stuff like that. Once they started their sprints, they were able to figure out how they could go faster. So they started estimating the side, the amount of points that they got per sprint, and they figured out what epitomes they had. They found that after a couple months, they accelerated from 20 points per sprint to 90 points per sprint. So that's 400% faster.\n\nNext chapter of the book is happiness, and the author writes about how happiness comes from the process and not the journey, it does not come from goals. And happiness is not just being happy, it's thriving, doing something hard, doing something good for the world. And I want to make a note about parenting, with my kids I want to be sure to reward processes not outcomes, because people tend to have a focus towards outcomes, not processes, that's something that I want to fix, that is a to-do item, that is something that I want to fix. There's a quote from the book Happier, which is that we are not rewarded for enjoying the journey itself, but for successful completion of a journey. Society rewards results, not processes, arrivals, not journeys. And if you do this, processes are what we spend 99% of our lives in, so it does not make sense to optimize for the results. Scrum is a process that realizes that people are people who have emotions that need to be solved or need to be at least some part of an equation. And I think that's kind of interesting, because there is an idea introduced in the book that how happy a company is can actually predict the revenue of the company. So if you have a happy company or happy organization, then it will be successful. This leads to the idea that happiness is success. So a general principle is that I should strive to be happy, because happiness not only correlates to success, but it actually causes success. There's a quote from a study, which is a meta-analysis of 225 papers with over 275,000 participants, that is that happiness leads to success in nearly every domain in our lives, including marriage, health, friendship, community involvement, creativity, and in particular, jobs, careers, and business. Happiness is a predictive measure of success. So, like, going back to the idea of processes and improving processes, in Scrum, the goal is to systematically build these small gestures of happiness into the system. Part of Scrum is to measure happiness. How do you quantify happiness? So at the end of every sprint, there's something called a sprint retrospective, which is where you think about what you've accomplished in the sprint, what things you've done, and you sit down and think about what went right, what could have gone better, what could be done in the next sprint, what can be improved. The idea of Kaizen is improvement. There's a PDA cycle called the plan-do-act-check cycle, and the retrospective is a checking part. Then next is that act step, which is Kaizen. So, if the goal is to improve happiness, you have to measure happiness, how to do so. You do that with, like, the author found that these questions are quite helpful. So, at the end of each sprint, each person on the team answers a few questions. One is, on a scale from 1 to 10, no, that's incorrect. On a scale from 1 to 5, how do you feel about your role in the company? On the same scale, how do you feel about the company as a whole? Why do you feel that way? What one thing would make you happier in the next sprint? And you have people write the answers to that. It takes a few minutes. But then the number one improvement for the next sprint is to do one of these Kaizens.\n\nOn the topic of happiness, there's a happiness metric for the author's company, and they found that happiness can be a predictive measure of the velocity. He found that if the company's happiness dropped, then a couple weeks later its productivity would vastly drop. The happiness of people is kind of like a sensor for how good the company will do, which makes sense because the company is fundamentally a bunch of people working together. This made me think about the author's claim that happiness is predictive, but why doesn't the author just have the people predict their speed in the next sprint instead of their happiness? Another topic is, what makes people happy? What makes people happy is having autonomy, mastery, and purpose. This is related to the book drive. The idea of autonomy is that you're able to control your destiny, and in order to do that, you have to have information. One fundamental part of a good company is to have everything be visible, having no secret agendas, nothing behind the curtain. Doing so increases the information that's being shared, which we've already seen is beneficial for a company, and it will also make people happier. A fundamental principle about having an organization is to make absolutely everything visible. Examples of this in practice is that in a Scrum company, every salary, every fee, every financial, every expenditure is available to everyone. It also improves happiness because there's not some class struggle of some people have information that other people don't. This is related to the idea of the Scrum board, which will show every single user story or task. Oh, and a fundamental misunderstanding that I had about task board is that each user story is kind of like a row, and then there are tasks to be done for each user story, not that each user story is actually a task. Each user story is made up of individual tasks. Anyway, by having this task board, which you can visualize it as also having columns where there's the backlog, there's to-do, there's in-progress, there's in-review slash QA, and then there's done. And just by looking at the board, you can see the status of the company.\n\nThere's a company mentioned in the book called Zappos and like a fundamental thing that this company wants to do is to maintain a connection between its employees. So maintaining a company culture. So by doing so they have a boot camp where they have all the new hires like for four weeks. The employees are brought to speed on how the company works, but also the company culture and it's like brutal, but the people in the boot camp bond with each other. So they automatically have the connections and because they have connections they are happier. And then the other thing is that the company culture is that they want people to grow so people feel better. So for example in Zappos, they hire people internally. And this is Zappos company because everyone feels connected, they all like to share that they feel the same goal. And also in Zappos the attrition rate is only 12%. And then people who are thriving in the company, they tend to perform 16% better than their peers, have 125% less burnout, 32% more commitment, 46% more satisfaction with their jobs. They take fewer sick days, have fewer doctor's appointments, and they're more likely to be promoted. And then a thriver is someone who has vitality and passion. They try to perfect their craft. And in order to help people become these thrivers, companies can encourage autonomy within people, like have people make their own decisions. And I just want to make a note about life principle that the most important thing to do in life is to constantly improve and never plateau. Focus only on how you can improve. This is very dangerous and should be kept in mind. Like the idea of being plateauing is common in companies and organizations, but this is very, very dangerous. And this is also very dangerous in your own life. To prevent complacency, always measure. So if you're always measuring something, then you can always see if you're improving or not. So this is a general principle in life and never stop measuring no matter what, otherwise you'll become complacent. I see this in my own life with my weight. I stopped measuring my weight and then I became complacent in my weight. And now I'm a little bit upset at where I am. And then the author also writes about the wise fool, which is someone who's able to ask uncomfortable questions or raise uncomfortable truths. There's a very memorable story about an emperor who was swindled by some swindlers. And the people made a robe that was out of fine silk. And they said that only people who are worthy are able to see it. So the emperor said that he was able to see it but it didn't acctually exist. Everyone around him said they could see it and the emporere was parading himself around the strreets completely naked. This Wise Fool is the child that can see that the accepted truth is just a consensual illusion. Cherish the Wise Fool.\n\nHere's an example of using Scrum for education. I mean, for one, just one idea that was interesting is that this is an example of using innovation where the where a teacher had a son who did software development at a company and they applied Scrum to education. So, by being exposed to a similar field, they were able to cross-pollinate and create different ideas. So, Scrum can and should be applied to all facets of life. It's a way for a team to produce value. So, it's used in education through the same process where there's a board, and there's statistics, and there's a group of people, and their goal is to learn the material as much as possible. TODO: Teach this to natalia. I should apply Scrum to people in my class. Like, do educational Scrum for people in my class. And I want to remember this in the book. Like, set up tasks to see how we can learn faster, etc. Teach each other, split up into teams, etc. Reading the part of the book about education Scrum was very interesting. A note for my future children is I want to send them to a Scrum school. And using Scrum in the classroom leads to better and self-guided learning. Students reflect and get themselves to be better. Another place where Scrum has been used is by treating poverty. There's an organization where they make applications for people to get information about farming. And their points, instead of being difficulty, their points are how much they think they can help other people. This is another note not related to the book. But that is that a problem of poor people was lack of information. By meeting and sharing information, they were able to increase their farming yields. And they were able to work more efficiently. And so this relates to Scrum points not having necessarily to be about revenue. It could be trying to optimize other things. Scrum is, in general, a way that teams can work together.",

Crucially, nothing should be moved to \"Done\" unless it's usable by the customer.\n\nFor example, with Wikispeed, if a car's turn signals are sticking, the related task isn't marked as \"Done\" until the issue is resolved and the user has verified it.\n\nThis implies that for an app, if a user story states they want to see their notes, the application must fully support that before marking the task as complete.\n\nOnce sprint tests are defined, nothing should be added mid-sprint.

More passengers in the car also increase accident risk. We often overestimate our ability to multitask. Ironically, those who multitask most tend to be the worst at it.\n\nThis makes me think: are there tasks that _don\u2019t_ suffer from multitasking? Like walking or breathing\u2014these are automatic. So maybe the problem is attention-bound tasks, not background ones.\n\nMultitasking might be more a symptom of poor systems than a necessity.

They provide the essential functions of a phone (communication over distance), having some additional features (gps, notes, calculator), without the \"smarter features\" (such as \"high performant applications\" or \"entertainment\"). They are harder to use and help \"[[reject convenience]]\"\n\nI think getting it is going to improve my life. I have gotten a glimpse of life without constant stimulation a few weeks ago when me and my roommates have formed a pact to use our phones less. I remember the feeling I had during the days of clarity in thought and [[intention]] in my actions. I have lost that a little bit because I had a bit of a habit of using laptop before bed, watching videos, masturbating, listening to music. This caused me to not go to bed. As of now, I am going to Madison Wisconsin and I want to make a large change to set myself up for a very goal-oriented summer. I have a lot of good momentum and in a much better mental position.\n\nI believe using a dumb-phone will help me reclaim even more of this thought and enforce to myself and my self-concept I am serious.\n\n### How it makes me think about others\n\nI have a little bt of a nagging feeling that technology addiction has snuck up on us. Every year a new phone is annouced and people get it because it is better, faster, more storage, but people never think about why they want those features. Sure they might want it because it is easier to use, but that is akin to a smoker getting a a more ergonomic pack of cigareets to minimize the time between opening the box and the cigareet entering his mouth. It is my belief phone mindless technology usage is harmful and I am getting off of this by using a dumb phone.\n\nEven now, I am not using my phone (because I have had a great habit of using it less, and I am writing instead. I am creating, using my brain, doing sometthing valuable.)\n\nUsing a dumbphone makes you an \"independent thinker\". I remember me being in high school and the teacher asked if anyone had an android. I was the only one in my class, but now I won't even have a smart phone. This makes me feel proud of myself, but I need to be warry of doing something just for the sake of being different.",
