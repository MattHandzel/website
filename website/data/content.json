You are able to sense when you feel tired better, estimate your state better. Your phone adds some noise to your internal measurements.\n\nMore social interactions, without a phone you are more inclined to talk to other people, even if this is 10% more often, the benefit will compound.\n\nI've ditched a smartphone and use a flip phone as my daily driver. Over the past few months of decreasing my dopamine baseline (listening to music, scrolling, being stimulated, porn, etc.) I've felt a fundamental change in my focus and how I spend my time.
