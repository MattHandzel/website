    "content": "**Time block**: 21:40-00:00\n**Activity**: watched YouTube\n\n**Log**:\n\n- Cognitively, how much energy did I have doing this activity? ([[estimate-energy-mood]])\n2\n\n- How much did I enjoy this activity?\n5\n\n**Plan**:\nMy plan for this time on my calendar was to do my night routine, go to bed.\n\n**Observations**:\n\n- What happened during the activity?\nReflection on last night, it was around 21:40, I got home from Grainger and I laid on my bed. I was tired, I made the choice to watch YouTube. What was going through my head was I just wanted to watch YouTube for 40 minutes then go to bed. I watched YouTube for 2 hours and 20 minutes. I started watching a video by Kurzgestat, then 2 videos by Veritasium. I wanted to watch the videos, they were in my recommended. I clicked on them, part of my head knowing I shouldn't click on them. \n\n- How did I feel before, during, and after the activity?\nI felt that it was okay for me to do this behavior. I didn't feel loss, I didn't think about my future self, I just thought about what would feel good in the moment. In my mind, I was thinking if I watch 40 minutes of YouTube I will feel better. During the activity, I felt the good mind-numbingness of YouTube videos\n\n**Evaluation**:\n\n- What went well and didn't? How did things not go as expected?\nI'm happy I didn't go way past my bedtime. Most other things did not go well, I was even watching YouTube videos while brushing my teeth! There was an extreme resistance against me pausing the video. As soon as a video ended, my monkey brain wanted another one. This makes me feel disgusting that I can be manipulated like this.\n\n- What surprised me or did I find challenging?\nI definitely am doing better than before, cognitively I felt I had a choice but chose wrong, instead of in the past me not feeling I have a choice. Looking back, I'm also realizing I don't really enjoy the activity that much. It's not that I wanted to read because it's better long term, I also just enjoy thinking much more. The problem is that reading and thinking is more difficult.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n- Why do I think things went well or poorly?\nI did have a very productive day, I finished the most important task for that day, got more caught up with my lectures, paid my bills, did work on my research. I was tired at the end of the day. The thought of reading marginally crossed my mind, if there was a book in my bed, I bet I would have read it. \nBecause I was drained, it doesn't mean I need to watch some brainrot to recover, it just makes me more susceptible to these stimulants. This is why I've gone about a week without watching or consuming anything and have made a poor decision last night.\nI also did this because of present bias.\n\n**Action**:\n\n- What is the single most impactful change I could make to improve this activity/system?\nNo phone in room after 22:00. I do this change when I have energy and _before_ I lie down. There is nothing I can do on my phone that I can't do on my computer.\n- What is the next concrete step I will take?\nLogout of YouTube on my phone so I won't see recommended videos.\nHave what I want to do on my bed, so I don't need to make a decision.\n\n**Questions**:",

    "content": "I just solved a bug where a JavaScript function was expecting the variables named `options` and `results`, but I was passing `chartData`. I was under the assumption if I passed in a value that was not defined in the function then it would throw an error. This is not how javascript works, though. This took me an hour to find.\n\n```js\nconst ScatterChart = ({ options, chartData }) => {\n  if (!options) throw new Error(\"options is required\");\n  if (!chartData)\n    throw new Error(\n      \"chartData is required, chartData is:\\n\" + JSON.stringify(chartData),\n    );\n  return <Scatter options={options} data={chartData} />;\n};\n\nexport default ScatterChart;\n```\n\nReflection: This took well over 1.5 hours to find. What I did was ask ChatGPT why the bug occured. It gave some potential reasons of the versions being out of date, but the versions are in date. Instead of asking ChatGPT why the error occured, I should ask it \"what are all the possible reasons this error could occur\". Instead of giving me one answer, it can give me several. Then, I can step-by-step eliminate them. I can also look to see what error is most likely given my context.\n\nA way to prevent this bug is to switch programming languages, that is not as feasible, but another way to prevent it is to mark your assumptions in your functions (i.e. xyz should not be null). The library I was working with should give a better error message.\n\nQuestion:\nHow else can I improve my debugging skills?",

This is really hard when they are face-to-face with you, but if they say I have to do it now, then tell them to leave.\nAlways sus out their intentions when someone comes to your door. \nIf there is a warning sign in your mind, then raise the alarm. I had some suspicion when the website was asking me to ensure they said they do not work for the power company.

    "content": "Next, I\u2019m going to be explaining another technique taught in class, which is Aspect-Based Reasoning Structure Extraction. The problem this is trying to solve is that some claims don\u2019t have a specific yes or no answer. For example, the lecture gave the example of vaccine A being better than vaccine B, but there are many different aspects in which vaccine A could be better or worse than vaccine B. The insight is that you need to break down these claims into specific aspects and then identify which of those aspects have been explored within the scientific corpus and which have scientific consensus behind them. The algorithm works by starting with a claim and generating coarse aspects that would impact that claim, such as efficacy, safety, and distribution. Then, you look into your corpus of documents and identify which documents are related to the specific aspect you want to discover more about \u2013 in the vaccine example, it would be safety. You then rank those documents based on their relevance to safety so that the LLM can use them in the future. However, this is actually a hierarchy, because safety can mean safety for whom? Safety for children, adults, or the elderly, and you have to iteratively discover more sub-aspects. When someone asks, \u201cIs vaccine A better than vaccine B?\u201d the LLM now has a bunch of different aspects of that claim and an idea of what aspects have scientific consensus. It could respond with something like, \u201cYes, 80% of the corpus agrees that vaccine A is safer for adults than vaccine B.\u201d\n## Screenshot\n![Screenshot](/home/matth/notes/capture/raw_capture/media/20250911_143345_561_screenshot.png)",

    "content": "So, I\u2019m going to share another paper that was discussed in this class \u2013 it\u2019s called KARE. It\u2019s a way to predict the outcome of a patient based on their context, and also provides reasoning for that prediction. It works in three steps: first, you start by attaining knowledge sources \u2013 biomedical knowledge graphs, biomedical core sources, and other information from LLMs. Then, you extract a knowledge graph, doing semantic clustering on the embeddings of the entities, and grouping things into communities to create a bunch of different corpuses. In those corpuses, you have information about interactions and the general theme. The next step is to construct and augment the patient\u2019s original context \u2013 you have the patient\u2019s chart and EHR, construct a knowledge graph from that, and then look at the community summaries, appending information related to their specific cases or illnesses, as well as similar cases with different outcomes. The purpose of that is to see what cues cause what outcome. Finally, you prompt a smaller LLM with this augmented context to provide reasoning as to what will happen to the patient and then predict the outcome. As for training the LLM, you already have the patient context and ground truth in your dataset, prompting a larger, smarter LLM to provide a high-quality reasoning chain, and those are the training signals. This dataset is about 16,000 patients \u2013 each has about 1.6 visits, 20 conditions, 4 procedures, and 30 medications on their chart. It\u2019s a relatively small dataset, but large enough to fine-tune a smaller LLM. The benefit of this algorithm is you have a smaller LLM (so better inference times, better generalization, more robust), you have the reasoning grounded in the medical knowledge graph.\n\n## Screenshot\n![Screenshot](/home/matth/notes/capture/raw_capture/media/20250911_142803_436_screenshot.png)",

The key insight is that the usage space and training space of these algorithms aren\u2019t aligned; Word2Vec is trained to maximize the dot product between two vectors if they appear closely together in text, but we typically use cosine similarity to assess how related two words are. So, there\u2019s a disconnect there. A student designed a training strategy that just used the cosine of the vectors instead of the dot product. I\u2019m confused because dot products are much faster than cosine similarity. Even if the training objective is perfectly aligned with the usage objective, I\u2019d assume you could train the other algorithms more and get a better result. However, this author found that the Jose method was the fastest in training time compared to Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, BERT, Foncar, and GloVe.",

    "content": "# Dynamic RAG\n\nI'm going to be giving a voice note on Dynamic RAG, which is a technique that was discussed in CS598JH. The title of the paper is Dynamic RAG, Leveraging Outputs of Large Language Models as Feedback for Dynamic Reranking in Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n\nTo start, to understand how RAG works, you have a generator, a retriever, a corpus document, a query, and you start with this query, then you have a retriever that retrieves some N documents from the corpus. Then you pass those N documents to a generator, and then it gives you your answer. But there's a problem that this N is a fixed value, and what was seen is that the order in which the documents are shown to the LLM also matters. So this retriever does not have the ability to rank the documents based off the importance to the query. It's probably simple just like embed documents with a cosine similarity, etc. And then the purpose of this work is to have a re-ranker that is able to take those N documents that are retrieved from the retriever and then rank them in an order that is better for the LLM, that makes the LLM generate a better answer, as well as decrease the number of documents to a number K, which the re-ranker gets to choose, because more documents does not always mean better. So how is this, so what is this re-ranker? It is another LLM that reads the documents and then it outputs an order for the documents to be in, and it also outputs the number K, which is the number of documents that are going to be passed to the next LLM.\n\nBut how do you actually train this LLM, how do you train this re-ranker LLM to give you not only good documents from the Scorpus, but also how do you train it so that the LLM improves its other LLM? Well, what you do is you have this training setup where you have an LLM that is a generator and then you freeze the weights of that LLM so that the LLM does not get updated at all. Then you train an LLM, you train the re-ranker LLM to output documents and then the frozen LLM generator will just generate documents based off the, or generate an answer based off the documents you received, then you, the LLM will generate many, like the re-ranker will generate many different series of documents, many different rankings of documents, and then pass that to an LLM, the LLM will generate an answer, and then based off that answer you'll compare that to a ground truth answer, and then you'll get a reward signal for the original re-ranker. So from this, now you have a reward signal that then you can update the weights of the original LLM re-ranker, and in this paper they use DPO as the learning algorithm. They show that they get better results than similar sized LLMs with other RAG algorithms, and then the LLAMA 8-billion is able to outperform the GPT-4-0 without retrieval. And then other results that they've shown that their RAG is better. What was interesting to me was that sometimes the LLM could just save that, could set k equal to zero, and make it so that no documents are passed to the generator LLM. I thought that's interesting. I would not have expected the LLM to find that behavior, but it was able to find that behavior.\n\n## Screenshot\n![Screenshot](/home/matth/notes/capture/raw_capture/media/20250911_135206_999_screenshot.png)",

From this causal graph, you can then use an LLM to learn why XYZ happened, by querying it with a question.

The goal is to extract a predefined schema of different arguments from a document, like magnitude, location, or date. You don\u2019t want to use a large language model for efficiency. So you extract numbers, dates, and other phrases like names. Then you have a template, and you say, \u201cAccording to this, the blank of this event is this entity.\u201d When I say blank, I mean these are the different arguments you have. The value that has the highest congruence is the correct value for that argument. You\u2019re not just asking, \u201cOh, what is the location of this earthquake?\u201d You\u2019re doing this in a smarter way, and you could use a smaller language model and get better accuracy.\n## Screenshot\n![Screenshot](/home/matth/notes/capture/raw_capture/media/20250910_210648_140_screenshot.png)",

    "content": "I do think that this method is very interesting. It's called ontotype, ontology-guided entity typing. The goal is to identify what an entity is. I thought it was interesting because it uses a small language model and it shows the efficiency in understanding and extracting the knowledge of a very small language model. How it works is that you have an entity that you want to identify its type. Then you prompt an LLM with a statement about what that entity is. So in this example, it is Wrigley Field. So you ask Wrigley Field the location. Is it a person? Is it an organization? And then you get some sort of confidence score from that statement. You get that from the small LLM. And then once you\u2019ve identified what class of entities it is, you can go down the street. So you know it\u2019s a location. Is it a country? Is it a city? Is it a building? You get the highest score from the confidence. So then you go down again. I think this is interesting because I can directly apply it to my note system. Instead of prompting an LLM, I can do it more efficiently. Instead of asking an LLM, what is this type, I can have this action. And I think a cool idea is that you progressively refine the type so you can stop at any time if you want a higher level idea of what an entity is.\n\n## Screenshot\n![Screenshot](/home/matth/notes/capture/raw_capture/media/20250910_205413_512_screenshot.png)",

    "content": "Hypercube Rag is a technique for doing retrieval where you enumerate the different possibilities for different semantic types and then you essentially do a union on all the different semantic types to get documents. For example, if you want to do retrieval related to tropical storm disasters, there are different semantic types for disaster, like location, event, and theme. A tropical storm has a location where it happened, it has a theme which could be the name of the tropical storm, and it also has the event of the tropical storm, like Hurricane Katrina. And there could be themes for the documents, maybe it's about how there was so much rain and it flooded, or it could be that there was a lot of wind. And these are semantic themes that could just segment the documents. And then from that you have a query. It's very easy to find the documents related to the theme if they're indexed in this way. I don't understand what is so special about this technique though.\n## Screenshot\n![Screenshot](/home/matth/notes/capture/raw_capture/media/20250910_205051_410_screenshot.png)",

Essentially, you train an LLM while using the search algorithm instead of adding it post-hoc, and this leads to better performance, specifically for searching, which is unsurprising to me. And then there\u2019s also this other algorithm that I mentioned, where you train an LLM to improve the search query before passing it into a search engine, and then the LLM can augment the search query. The LLM is essentially trained to have a search query that maximizes the F1 score. This allows it to have better retrieval, and then better retrieval leads to much better performance, which is shown by one of the graphs where they have DeepSeek, a 3-billion-parameter DeepSeek, outperform GPT-4.0 and Cloud Sonnet when it comes to information retrieval.",

    "content": "So part of it was initial fear and discomfort. I think that came from me being inauthentic because Siri told me that I should just go up to her, but there\u2019s no reason for me to go up to her. Then Siri suggested that I should tell her that I want to walk in with her instead of just talk with Siri and her friends, and this was a very good reason, and it is true, so I felt much more confident about that. In my mind, I was envisioning a playfulness of me going up to her table, sitting down, and just like teasing my friends that I actually have to do work and kind of smiling at her and letting her know that I\u2019m just interested. That\u2019s a version of myself that I envision, and that\u2019s how I will be in the future, and that\u2019s a version of myself that I want to be. So I think the reason why I did not initially do it was because of a lack of authenticity, and then once I had an authentic reason for going to her to do it and actually I think the main reason maybe was not part of it was definitely the authenticity, but another reason is probably the playfulness. I did not have a playful reason to go up to her and talk with her, but once I had a playful reason, I was in a much better mindset. So I think that in these types of cases, I should try to think of a playful way to approach people. People vary like the playfulness, and I\u2019ve seen this in my own life when I\u2019ve approached girls in the past. So in the future, the next time I am in a position where I will actually want to approach a girl, I will identify what\u2019s an authentic reason I want to go up to her and talk to her, and I will try to think of how I can make it playful.",

They have a meeting a month where everyone is just in a room and they do nothing. If people can't make it to that meeting, then it means that they\u2019re too busy or there aren\u2019t enough people.

(5)  \n- How much did I enjoy this activity? (Yes, I enjoyed it; skipped one question)  \n\n**Plan**: Improve performance by testing and fixing the behavior of the model that formatted output weirdly.  \n\n**Observations**:  \n- I occasionally checked emails instead of focusing.  \n- I felt sharper and smarter during this session.  \n- Completed changes and refactored the script effectively, reducing it from two scripts to one Python script.  \n\n**Feedback**:  \n\n- Where did I waste time, energy, or focus?  \nManaging focus due to email distractions.  \n\n- What is the single most impactful change I could make to improve this activity/system?  \nUse a timer during active blocks to prevent email checking.  \n\n- Could I automate, delegate, or simplify any part of this process?  \nYes, simplify by keeping the script\u2019s responsibilities minimal: just take input, call Ollama, and return output. Avoid clipboard operations.  \n\n- If I could do this activity again, what would I do differently?  \nMaintain tighter focus and avoid context-switching into email.  \n\n- Are there alternative approaches or methods that might yield better results?  \nAddress Thunderbird Calendar\u2019s notification bug (report to developers, test fixes).  \n\n- What is the next concrete action to improve this system?  \nLearn to use Copilot in the terminal and experiment with Gemini to reduce manual copy-paste.  \n\n- Should I experiment with a small change or a larger redesign?  \nStart with a small change (use a focus timer, simplify script responsibilities).  \n\n- Did I leave anything half-finished?  \nNo, I completed refactoring into one script.",

I also was about to buy the reclaim application which is good cuz I think that it would save me more than 30 minutes per month of time and it only cost $8. but then I remembered from the last time I tried to buy something that I could look for student discounts and there is a 50% soon discount that I'm trying again. so that is also on the up and up by me doing this recording right now after the event has happened. I'm also doing a very good job.

If users had perfect knowledge and understanding about how they work, their preferences, and all of the new information about the new change, then they would be oracles. I wonder if there is a way, when asking users what they want, to prompt users to give better responses--is this what the field of studying user interviews is about?\n\n```\nAnother example: Google has discovered that when they survey users about how many search results they want per page (10, 20, 30), users overwhelmingly say \u201c30 results\u201d. But when Google actually deploys 30-result search pages (as part of an \u201cA/B test\u201d, which we\u2019ll talk about in a later reading), usage drops by 20% relative to the conventional 10-result page. Why? Probably because the 30-result page takes a half second longer to load (The Cost of Latency).\n```",

I think _most_ people give the opinions by others too much weight relative to their importance when it comes to deciding for courses. Right now, I am trying to decide on what courses to take. Past me would have solicited advice from other students whom have taken this class, and if he was extremely diligent, weight all of their advice against each other. I think this is fundamentally flawed, when they say \"x is a good class\" that doesn't give you that much information. It misses out the nuance about why they think it is a good class. Is the advicer aligned in your goals, knows your particular situation? Most likely not. When listening to advice it should decrease your \"error bars\" along the estimate, but you need to be particular about biases. For this reason, I think I need to apply the ideas of thinking for yourself to actually come to a good decision myself. I need to come up with my own searching strategy, my own criteria for what a good class is, with this method, I think I can make decisions much better.",
