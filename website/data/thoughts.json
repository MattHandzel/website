    "content": "I have this behavior where I try and \"brute force\" some problem I am trying to solve. For homework problems, I tend to \"do them\" instead of thinking about them. I try one solution, and then instead of re-evaluating why it didn't work and what could work, I just try the next thing that comes to my head. This is especially a problem when it comes to developing and debugging. I want to fix this, I think by starting a timer when I start to do a solution, then when the timer goes off I evaluate myself, if I have started this habit of going down a rabbit hole, then I take a step back.",

    "content": "This tweet states there are these three discrete levels, but I believe everyone is a mix of the three different levels.\nI think I have parts of me on all three levels. I was definitely at level 1 freshmen year of college, and it was only until Fall semester of Sophomore year (when I decided _not_ to try and go to a prestigious graduate school) that I achieved level 2.\nI love the idea of our life as an art project.",

    "content": "Free recall for this article. The goal is to do homework assignments before the following lecture's material is covered. This is especially true if the lecture builds on the previous material (which it almost always does). Doing this strategy means it will be easy for you to follow on the next classes lecture material.\n\nMoreover, you don't need to complete the whole homework, doing just part of it is worthwhile for studying.",
