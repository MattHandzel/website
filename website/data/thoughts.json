Avoid clipboard operations.  \n\n- If I could do this activity again, what would I do differently?  \nMaintain tighter focus and avoid context-switching into email.  \n\n- Are there alternative approaches or methods that might yield better results?  \nAddress Thunderbird Calendar\u2019s notification bug (report to developers, test fixes).  \n\n- What is the next concrete action to improve this system?  \nLearn to use Copilot in the terminal and experiment with Gemini to reduce manual copy-paste.  \n\n- Should I experiment with a small change or a larger redesign?  \nStart with a small change (use a focus timer, simplify script responsibilities).  \n\n- Did I leave anything half-finished?  \nNo, I completed refactoring into one script.",

I wonder if there is a way, when asking users what they want, to prompt users to give better responses--is this what the field of studying user interviews is about?\n\n```\nAnother example: Google has discovered that when they survey users about how many search results they want per page (10, 20, 30), users overwhelmingly say \u201c30 results\u201d. But when Google actually deploys 30-result search pages (as part of an \u201cA/B test\u201d, which we\u2019ll talk about in a later reading), usage drops by 20% relative to the conventional 10-result page. Why? Probably because the 30-result page takes a half second longer to load (The Cost of Latency).\n```",

Past me would have solicited advice from other students whom have taken this class, and if he was extremely diligent, weight all of their advice against each other. I think this is fundamentally flawed, when they say \"x is a good class\" that doesn't give you that much information. It misses out the nuance about why they think it is a good class. Is the advicer aligned in your goals, knows your particular situation? Most likely not. When listening to advice it should decrease your \"error bars\" along the estimate, but you need to be particular about biases. For this reason, I think I need to apply the ideas of thinking for yourself to actually come to a good decision myself. I need to come up with my own searching strategy, my own criteria for what a good class is, with this method, I think I can make decisions much better.",
