I'm definitely doing a better job in terms of my productivity because I recognize that I need to take a break and let myself take a break. I also was about to buy the reclaim application which is good cuz I think that it would save me more than 30 minutes per month of time and it only cost $8. but then I remembered from the last time I tried to buy something that I could look for student discounts and there is a 50% soon discount that I'm trying again. so that is also on the up and up by me doing this recording right now after the event has happened. I'm also doing a very good job. I am building a habit of taking breaks when I'm doing things and during those breaks me reflecting. so I think that if I just add more structured brakes into my day, I will have the opportunity to do more reflections.",

I wonder if there is a way, when asking users what they want, to prompt users to give better responses--is this what the field of studying user interviews is about?\n\n```\nAnother example: Google has discovered that when they survey users about how many search results they want per page (10, 20, 30), users overwhelmingly say \u201c30 results\u201d. But when Google actually deploys 30-result search pages (as part of an \u201cA/B test\u201d, which we\u2019ll talk about in a later reading), usage drops by 20% relative to the conventional 10-result page. Why? Probably because the 30-result page takes a half second longer to load (The Cost of Latency).\n```",

    "content": "Right now, I am performing my semesterly dance to decide on courses I want to take. I want to reflect on the topic of others giving advice for courses. I think _most_ people give the opinions by others too much weight relative to their importance when it comes to deciding for courses. Right now, I am trying to decide on what courses to take. Past me would have solicited advice from other students whom have taken this class, and if he was extremely diligent, weight all of their advice against each other. I think this is fundamentally flawed, when they say \"x is a good class\" that doesn't give you that much information. It misses out the nuance about why they think it is a good class. Is the advicer aligned in your goals, knows your particular situation? Most likely not. When listening to advice it should decrease your \"error bars\" along the estimate, but you need to be particular about biases. For this reason, I think I need to apply the ideas of thinking for yourself to actually come to a good decision myself.

This is especially true if the lecture builds on the previous material (which it almost always does). Doing this strategy means it will be easy for you to follow on the next classes lecture material.\n\nMoreover, you don't need to complete the whole homework, doing just part of it is worthwhile for studying.",

When I was in San Francisco, I had a lot of these opportunities for me to learn a lot from these events. But, at UIUC, this is not as easy.
