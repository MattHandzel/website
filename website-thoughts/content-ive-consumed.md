# Content Ive Consumed

Similar to [[jeremy-kintana|jeremy-kintana's]] substack, I want to show what articles, books, etc. I've consumed and my thoughts on them. I think this is extremely important to publish my thoughts and it allows me to interact with the content more, which improes my recall, and others can talk to me about it.
