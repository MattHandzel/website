# Map

The purpose of this map is so that anyone can look on my personal website and see where I'll be in the future. I can embed this into an email, a footer for an email, my personal newsletter, etc. With this, I can "create" luck, (my network can give me ideas about trips I plan on going. If they plan on being in the same area at the time they can say hi). I can imagine this becoming generalized so that everyone has a map like this so their network can see where they will be.

Maybe for my network, other people can write when and where they will be in the future and then I can see this on my map. I imagine this being in an email, someone is going on a trip to Spain in September, and then they can click on the map, a date, and then it will send me an email where they will be in the future. This is just me getting more value from my network. This should be accessible to anyone on my website. They also should be able to write a description of what they're doing there, why they are going, etc. This means my website won't be just a static website.

On a map I can visualize a lot of things, specifically my travels, where I've been and where I intend on being in the future. I image a map with a timeline where the user can scrub forward and backwards to see how I have traveled, they can maybe select a range of time (example October 2024-January 2025) and then see where I've been during that time.

This system can perhaps interact with my personal network? It can show events in my life, such as when and where I met specific people during my travels.

I can/want to do something like this: https://aaronparecki.com/2012/03/06/7/everywhere-ive-been-gps-data-portraits
