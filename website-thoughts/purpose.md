# Purpose

My online website should be my entire online brand. It should have everything anyone would need to know about me on there. It should combine all of instagram, linkedin, etc.

For example, my internship at epic I should have on there, all of my adventures, accomplishments, periods in my life

My online website should use data about my life from my obsidian vault.

From this website, someone can get a hollistic view of who I am as a person.

By building this so that it is available on my website, anything I put on there I implicitly build a tracking system.

My website is me "living in public"

For most of my areas of my life, my systems, interests, have them be visible on my website

A principle for this website is the idea of others being able to quickly and easily interact with my ideas, leave me notes. This can be component specific. For example, in the physiological health metrics component, someone can select a part of the chart and give me a suggestion for that. For the map component, someone can highlight a section and tell me about how there is something very cool there. They can also highlight it and say they will be there in the future. Give a lot of interactivity to this. Allow the user to login and write their name on my personal website, by going on my personal website, they are personally interacting with me.

I want to record how people interact with my website, using something like posthog.
