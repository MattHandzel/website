# Communities

The purpose of this is so that others can see what communities I am a part of. I want them to be able to search semantically and by keywords.

I want others to know what communities I am a part of. I have a markdown document [[communities-i-am-a-part-of]] that lists the communities I am a part of, how much I identify with that community, as well as a description. I want others to be able to visualize it. I am thinking about a component at "matthandzel.com/communities" that is a semantic map of the communities I am a part of.

What are some better ways to visualize what communities I am a part of?

- I can have a photo of me at every community gathering/"in the outfit" of the community
  - for example, polish community I can be at the Polish club
  - running community I can be on a run, etc.
