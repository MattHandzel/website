# Digital gardens / note-graphs

- **Andy Matuschak — evergreen notes / public notebook.** Great example of notes-as-thinking-space (bi-directional links, evergreen notes). ([Andyʼs working notes][1])
  _What to borrow:_ the “notes as UI” approach and minimal metadata for each note.

- **Maggie Appleton — visual digital garden & “historical trails.”** Beautiful visual essays and patterns (good examples of showing journeys & trails through ideas). ([maggieappleton.com][2])
  _What to borrow:_ visual/illustrated essays and the “trail” metaphor for showing where you’ve been intellectually or physically.

- **Joel Hooks — “your friend Joel’s digital garden.”** Clean digital-garden layout + a NOW page. ([joelhooks.com][3])
  _What to borrow:_ simple garden index, tag filters, and a readable “now” summary.

- **Sindhu (sindhu.live) — personal garden + now/guestbook.** Compact, readable garden with a “now” and garden/lore split. ([sindhu.live][4])
  _What to borrow:_ approachable “garden” UI and season/now updates.

# Travel / maps / location timelines

- **Aaron Parecki — GPS logs, “Everywhere I’ve Been” maps, monthly summaries.** Aaron publishes GPS-derived maps and monthly travel summaries — a direct model for your travel timeline/map idea. ([aaronparecki.com][5])
  _What to borrow:_ ingest GPS/GPX logs to build animated “where I was” timelines and monthly map views.

- **Simon Willison — geospatial experiments, mapping infrastructure & examples.** Lots of practical mapping work and demos — useful when you build custom map features (isochrones, map tiles). ([Simon Willison’s Weblog][6])
  _What to borrow:_ pragmatic approach to self-hosting map data and building performant interactive maps.

# Quantified-self / life metrics / dashboards

- **howisFelix.today (Felix Krause) — full personal metrics site.** Tracks \~100 data types (fitness, social, computer use, weather) and visualizes them. Great example of a personal dashboard / life database. ([howisfelix.today][7], [GitHub][8])
  _What to borrow:_ data model for cross-domain metrics and the dashboard layout for asking questions of your life.

- **Maggie Delano — quantified-self projects & reports.** Longstanding QS contributor with projects and data visualizations (pomodoro tracking, talks). ([Maggie Delano][9])
  _What to borrow:_ how to present self-tracking as narrative reports and conference talks.

- **Buster Benson — notes + “life in weeks” and yearly reviews.** Great examples of periodic life reviews and compact visualizations. ([Buster’s Notes][10])
  _What to borrow:_ how to structure annual / weekly retrospectives as shareable pages.

# Now-pages, timelines & “what I’m doing”

- **Aaron Parecki — /now and “monthly summaries” (map + stats).** Simple, machine-friendly now page plus monthly summary with travel map. ([aaronparecki.com][11])
  _What to borrow:_ automated now/monthly pages powered by scripts.

- **Joel Hooks — now + digital-garden entries for narrative timeline feel.** Good for blending “now” with longer-term notes. ([main--joelhooks-com.netlify.app][12])

# Community / memberships / “semantic map of communities”

- **Maggie Appleton — patterns about gatherings & “gathering structures.”** Useful design patterns for visualizing communities and events in context. ([maggieappleton.com][13])
  _What to borrow:_ pattern language for representing communities and events.

- **Rach Smith — accessible digital garden + “month notes & numbers.”** A practical example of a garden that includes periodic summary pages and tags for community topics. ([rachsmith.com][14])

# One-stop collections (to mine more live personal sites)

- **A Digital Garden Inventory (Medium)** — curated list of \~50 real personal digital gardens (handy for finding more live personal sites to copy). ([Medium][15])

If you want, next I can do one of these _concrete_ follow-ups (pick one and I’ll run it right now):

1. **Deep dive: top 6 live sites** — take screenshots of the 6 best matches (map, quantified, garden, timeline) and write a 1-paragraph “lift/steal” plan for each (layout + components + minimal tech).
2. **Prototype checklist** — pick 3 live examples and produce a tiny page wireframe (which components go where + data fields to store).
3. **Starter repo** — a minimal Next.js starter that includes: Obsidian markdown import, a simple map page (Leaflet/Mapbox), and a demo quantified-data dashboard (mock data).

Which of those would you like me to do next?
